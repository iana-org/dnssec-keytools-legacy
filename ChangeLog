	* Changes to the KSK Generator “kskgen” component:

	2. kskgen/kskparams.h:
	a. Changed the certificate signing request Organization (O) from ICANN to 
	   Public Technical Identifiers (PTI) to reflect the organization PTI as the 
	   new Root Zone KSK Operator.

	   Cryptographic Business Operations.

	* Other changes:

2016-04-19	ZSK Length Change

	Version 20160419

	* Changes to the KSR Signer “ksrsigner” component:

	1. ksrsigner/ksrcommon.c
	2. ksrsigner/ksrcommon.h
	3. ksrsigner/ksrpolicy.h
	4. ksrsigner/ksrsigner.c
	5. ksrsigner/wksr.c

	a. Added support for multiple SignatureAlgorithm fields and check
	   the field on incoming KSR against actual key material and match fields
	   outgoing SKR. Specifically it was discovered that neither ICANN nor
	   Verisign were inspecting RequestPolicy or ResponsePolicy sections of
	   the KSR-SKR XML exchange.  This was evidenced by the incorrect key
	   exponent “3” being passed back and forth since the first key ceremony
	   when it should have been “65537”. This had no effect on operations.
	   However, it does not meet the specifications originally laid out.
	b. Added tests for other fields in the ksr.xml fields including:
	   Exponent length, SignatureAlgorithm and keytag. 
	c. Removed tests that limited acceptable KSR formats to allow for
	   extended single ZSK use across KSRs.


2011-09-21	180 Days Warning	

	Version 20110921

	Allowed signings prior to 180 days from signature expiration. The idea
	is to keep the 180-day validation but to replace the error (signing
	interception) with a warning so that the signing could still be
	completed.


2010-10-29	x509 Schema
	
	Version 20101029

	Changed to x509 schema.


2010-06-12	Original

	Version 20100612

	First version.
